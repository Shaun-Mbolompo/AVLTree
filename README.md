# AVLTree

Hi, I run the experiment through using AVLExperiment program.
I use it to generate randomised arrays from the vaccinations.csv file extracted from the web and then store the data in an AVL tree.
I used the data from the vaccinations.csv to test the AVL tree with different randomised datasets of the same data in order to prove that AVL trees do balance the nodes and provide good performance for storage and retrieval of data.

To run the experiment on your pc you need to be on the terminal and type python3 Automation.py and depending on your python version, you can replace python3 with the one you are using.
When running the experiment a GUI will pop up with further instruction on how to proceed with the experiment. 

I hope you are excited to embark on this experiment, enjoy.

Thank you!

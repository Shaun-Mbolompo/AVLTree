# AVLTree

Hi, I run the experiment through using AVLExperiment program. I use it to generate randomised arrays from the vaccinations.csv file and store the data
in an AVL tree. I then use the data items from the vaccinations.csv to test the AVL tree with the different ordered data to see if it does balance the
nodes and provide good performance for storage and retrieval of data.
If you press 'Run experiment', the experiment will be carried and the results of the experiment will be shown in few minutes. For you to end the program 
you will need to close the two graphs by clicking on the close icon on the top right after viewing them.
If you have problem seeing the graphs, you should install the matplotlib.pyplot libaray in your pc.

Thank you!
